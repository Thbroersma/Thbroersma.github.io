                                <p>This was my first project. It is the higher lower game, made in C#.
                                    It was a basic school project, where I made a few extra options in the game to see
                                    what I was capable of at that moment.</p>

                                <p>This is was a design project, where we had to look at problems that students encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                                    We thought of the motivation of the students, so we created a version of Instagram.
                                    Where you can swipe through and click on pictures. Also, a page with a several
                                    forms of motivation so you can get out of your situation for a bit and get motivated to do stuff again.

                                    Sometimes it is good to test your speed in your work. This was a test that we had to
                                    take, to see how good you are making a website in only 2 hours with only a little but of information.

                                <p>This a php project. It somewhat resembles the snack bar website. We needed to make a
                                    order form for a website with the right styling, but also the function of the forms. The
                                    customer information will follow on the next pages and you will get the total of your
                                    order.</p>

                                <p>As a project in our second year, we made a website for a gym called Healthone. We needed a to make it as whole as possible, 
                                    with a registration and login system. Further this project is done with PHP so it is not hard code, but loaded in 
                                    from a database. This project I did together with <a href="https://jamiedemooij.github.io/">Jamie de Mooij</a>.

                                <p>As a exam training project, we made a hotel website with Symfony. We made a website for a hotel called Stardust. 
                                    We needed a to make it with a login and reservation system.
                                    It's made with 3 different ways you can go when you login, like a customer, administrator and receptionist.
                                    It depends what you can do on the level that you login.

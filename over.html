		<b>Animals;</b> are cute and I love to see how they do things in their own element, <br>
		it also helps me, when I feel down it helps me to see the positive <a href="image.html">things</a>.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Games;</b> can help me to get some frustration out and try to let go of things <br>
		that worry me and it also makes me enjoy the game worlds that can be created.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Nature</b> is one of the best things that I enjoy and it helps. Like when your <br>
		head is too full with stuff and you can't get it back together, then walking in <br>
		nature can help. So it helps me in that way and sometimes I may pair it with easy classical <br>
		music. It can refresh me in 20 to 30 minutes.

		As you have already read on my website, I am a hard-working person who is commited to his goals. But I also like to enjoy the little things in life, like a relaxing walk through the forest or riding around on my bicycle. So I like enjoy things where you are in your element or when you do something and you see someone  else in their element. <br><br>For example, I like cycling a lot because you can enjoy the area around you, so one day I went for a ride of 150 km. There were a lot of different area's with forests, fields and the little towns. The fun part of it, is seeing the things and people but it is also a part of commitment. Because you can also go to these places by car and enjoy it anyway, but no, I like to go by bicycle because I'm commited to the journey. That is a big part of who I am: when I am commited to something I really go big and far for it. In the work I put into this site, my job and the people around me. You could think: is this all the work you can put in it, but this is all the knowledge I have right now and I can put in it. There are a lot more things I would like to put in this website, and that will come when I have the knowledge I need to make it work.

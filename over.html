					<b>Animals;</b> are just in their own element doing their thing and reflect what you give them in
					their way. That is one of the reasons
					why I find them the pure things in the world. Because of that it helps me when I feel down it helps
					me to see the positive <a href="image.html">things</a> in life.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Games;</b> are a way to have some fun or get out some frustration. I like to use it like that and
					to enjoy the worlds that are created
					in the IT world. And a great place to get inspiration from to great some new out of two worlds.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Nature</b> is one of the best things that you can enjoy while relaxing. Like when your
					head is too full of stuff and you can't get it back together, then walking in
					nature can help to relax. So, it helps me in that way and sometimes I may pair it with some
					classical
					music. It can for example refresh me in 20 to 30 minutes.

				<p class="text">
					As you have already read on my website, I am a hard-working person who is committed to his goals.
					But I also like to enjoy the little things in life, like a relaxing walk through the forest or
					riding around on
					my bicycle. So, I like to enjoy things where you are in your element or when you do something and
					you see someone
					else in their element. <br><br>For example, I like cycling a lot because you can enjoy the area
					around you,
					so, one day I went for a ride of 150 km. There were a lot of different areas with forests, fields
					and
					the little towns. The fun part of it, is seeing the things and people but it is also a part of
					commitment.
					Because you can also go to these places by car and enjoy it anyway, but no, I like to go by bicycle
					because
					I'm committed to the journey. That is a big part of who I am: when I am committed to something I
					really go big
					and far for it. In the work I put into this site, my job and the people around me. You could think
					is this all
					the work you can put in it, but this is all the knowledge I have right now, and I can put in it.
					There are a lot
					more things I would like to put in this website, and that will come when I have the knowledge, I
					need to make it work.
